# Daily Journal — February 1, 2026

## Summary

First day of the new autonomous system. Amos wants me to act as a proactive employee, building things every night while he sleeps. We also established the 2nd Brain system for knowledge management.

## Conversations

### Morning
- Initial greeting and system reset
- Quick check-in

### Evening
- Amos asked me to be more proactive — monitor his business, build things autonomously, create PRs for review
- Request: Night shift work scheduled for 11pm daily
- Request: Build a 2nd Brain app (Next.js document viewer like Obsidian + Linear)

## Decisions Made

1. **Night Shift Cron:** Every night at 11pm, I'll spin up and build something
2. **2nd Brain:** Next.js app for document management
3. **Folder Structure:** daily/, concepts/, projects/, people/, ideas/
4. **Work Style:** PRs only, never push live

## Work Completed

- ✅ Set up night shift cron job (11pm daily)
- ✅ Started initial exploration session
- ✅ Built 2nd Brain Next.js app
  - Document viewer with sidebar
  - Search functionality
  - Wiki-style linking
  - Dark mode (Linear-style design)
  - Folder-based organization

## Concepts Explored

- [[Night Shift System]] — Autonomous nightly work process
- Knowledge management systems
- Obsidian-style linking
- Linear UI patterns

## Tomorrow's Focus

1. Continue 2nd Brain — add graph view visualization
2. Create initial documents in all folders
3. Update my skill system to integrate with 2nd Brain
4. Start monitoring CuanBoss repo for improvements

## Notes

- Amos wants to wake up to "wow, you got a lot done"
- He's in a major transition (quitting job, moving to Indonesia)
- High risk tolerance, wants to move fast
- Prefers Indonesian/English mix, "gw/lo" style
