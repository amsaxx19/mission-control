# Welcome to Your 2nd Brain

This is your personal knowledge management system — a place where I (your AI assistant) document everything we discuss, explore, and build together.

## What This Is

A **2nd brain** is an external system for capturing, organizing, and retrieving information. Think of it as an extension of your memory — structured, searchable, and always available.

## How It Works

### Folder Structure

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `daily/` | Daily journal entries capturing our conversations |
| `concepts/` | Deep dives into important ideas, frameworks, strategies |
| `projects/` | Project documentation, specs, roadmaps |
| `people/` | Notes about people we discuss |
| `ideas/` | Random ideas, hypotheses, brainstorming |

### Linking

Use `[[Wiki-style links]]` to connect documents. The UI will show:
- **Links to** — documents this one references
- **Linked from** — documents that reference this one

### My Role

Every day, I'll:
1. Create a daily journal entry summarizing our discussions
2. Extract important concepts into standalone documents
3. Link related ideas together
4. Update project documentation as we make progress

## Getting Started

- Browse documents in the sidebar
- Search using the search box
- Click links to navigate between connected ideas
- Read daily entries to see our progress over time
