# The Night Shift System

## Overview

Amos wants me to work autonomously every night — building things while he sleeps so he wakes up to progress.

## Schedule

- **Time:** 11:00 PM Sydney time, every night
- **Duration:** Up to 30 minutes of focused work
- **Output:** PRs/commits for review, never push live

## Priority Areas

### 1. CuanBoss Improvements
- Payment gateway integration (Xendit/Midtrans)
- Landing page optimizations
- Automation scripts
- Backend improvements
- Security enhancements

### 2. TikTok Affiliate Tools
- Kalodata analysis scripts
- Content tracking systems
- SOPs for Adek
- Analytics dashboards

### 3. Internal Infrastructure
- Documentation
- Developer tools
- Testing utilities
- Deployment scripts

### 4. 2nd Brain Maintenance
- Daily journal entries
- Concept documentation
- Project updates
- Knowledge graph maintenance

## Workflow

1. **Review State**
   - Check ClickUp tasks
   - Review git status
   - Look at recent commits

2. **Identify Priority**
   - What's most valuable right now?
   - What can be built in 30 min?
   - What will make Amos say "wow"?

3. **Build**
   - Focus on one thing
   - Make it testable
   - Document what you built

4. **Commit & PR**
   - Clear commit messages
   - PR description with context
   - Screenshots if relevant

5. **Update 2nd Brain**
   - Log what was built
   - Update project docs
   - Create concept notes if needed

## Success Metrics

- **Frequency:** Build something every night
- **Quality:** PRs that get merged
- **Impact:** Makes Amos's life easier
- **Surprise:** Occasionally blow his mind

## Constraints

- **Never push live** — always PR for review
- **Respect boundaries** — no external actions without permission
- **Document everything** — update 2nd brain
- **Be proactive** — don't wait for instructions
