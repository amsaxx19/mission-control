Amos wants me to act as a proactive employee, building things every night while he sleeps. We also established the 2nd Brain system for knowledge management.\n\n## Conversations\n\n### Morning\n- Initial greeting and system reset\n- Quick check-in\n\n### Evening\n- Amos asked me to be more proactive — monitor his business, build things autonomously, create PRs for review\n- Request: Night shift work scheduled for 11pm daily\n- Request: Build a 2nd Brain app (Next.js document viewer like Obsidian + Linear)\n\n## Decisions Made\n\n1. **Night Shift Cron:** Every night at 11pm, I'll spin up and build something\n2. **2nd Brain:** Next.js app for document management\n3. **Folder Structure:** daily/, concepts/, projects/, people/, ideas/\n4. **Work Style:** PRs only, never push live\n\n## Work Completed\n\n- ✅ Set up night shift cron job (11pm daily)\n- ✅ Started initial exploration session\n- ✅ Built 2nd Brain Next.js app\n  - Document viewer with sidebar\n  - Search functionality\n  - Wiki-style linking\n  - Dark mode (Linear-style design)\n  - Folder-based organization\n\n## Concepts Explored\n\n- [[Night Shift System]] — Autonomous nightly work process\n- Knowledge management systems\n- Obsidian-style linking\n- Linear UI patterns\n\n## Tomorrow's Focus\n\n1. Continue 2nd Brain — add graph view visualization\n2. Create initial documents in all folders\n3. Update my skill system to integrate with 2nd Brain\n4. Start monitoring CuanBoss repo for improvements\n\n## Notes\n\n- Amos wants to wake up to \"wow, you got a lot done\"\n- He's in a major transition (quitting job, moving to Indonesia)\n- High risk tolerance, wants to move fast\n- Prefers Indonesian/English mix, \"gw/lo\" style\n\n---\n\n*Created by AI assistant during night shift setup*",

Capture Everything\nEvery significant conversation, decision, or idea gets documented.\n\n### 2. Link Relentlessly\nConnect ideas using `[[Wiki Links]]`. The system visualizes connections between documents.\n\n### 3. Daily Journaling\nEach day gets its own entry — a high-level summary of discussions and work.\n\n### 4. Concept Extraction\nImportant ideas get pulled out into standalone documents for deeper exploration.\n\n## Folder Structure\n\n```\ndocs/\n├── daily/          # Daily journal entries\n├── concepts/       # Deep dives into ideas\n├── projects/       # Active project documentation  \n├── people/         # People profiles\n└── ideas/          # Random thoughts & hypotheses\n```\n\n## How I Use It\n\n### During Conversations\n- Take mental notes on important points\n- Identify concepts worth documenting\n- Note decisions and action items\n\n### After Conversations\n1. **Create daily entry** — High-level summary of what we discussed\n2. **Extract concepts** — If we discussed something important, create a concept doc\n3. **Update projects** — If we made progress on a project, update its docs\n4. **Link everything** — Connect related documents with wiki links\n\n### During Night Shift\n- Review the day's conversations\n- Fill in gaps in documentation\n- Research and expand on concepts\n- Create new connections between ideas\n\n## Document Format\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: Document Title\ndate: 2026-02-01\ntags: [tag1, tag2]\n---\n\n# Title\n\nContent here...\n\nLink to [[Another Document]]\n```\n\n## Benefits for Amos\n\n1. **Memory** — Never forget important context\n2. **Continuity** — Each session starts with full context\n3. **Pattern Recognition** — See connections between ideas over time\n4. **Knowledge Building** — Accumulate expertise, not just tasks\n\n## Benefits for Me\n\n1. **Context** — Understand Amos better over time\n2. **Consistency** — Maintain continuity across sessions\n3. **Proactivity** — Spot patterns and suggest things\n4. **Growth** — Document what I learn about his business\n\n## Roadmap\n\n- [ ] Graph visualization (force-directed graph of connections)\n- [ ] Full-text search within document content\n- [ ] Daily note templates\n- [ ] Integration with ClickUp (sync tasks)\n- [ ] Mobile app (PWA)\n- [ ] AI-powered insights (\"You mentioned X 3 months ago...\")\n\n---\n\n*The 2nd Brain lives in `/second-brain/` — a Next.js app that renders these markdown files into a beautiful document viewer.*",
