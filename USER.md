## Context

Amos is in a major life transition — leaving stable Australian office work to return to Indonesia and bet on himself as an entrepreneur. He's seen AI disrupt his industry (friends laid off) and doesn't want to be replaceable. He's hungry, ambitious, and has a clear vision of the life he wants (luxury lifestyle, financial freedom).

He needs tools and systems that help him:
- Track his many projects/tasks
- Stay organized during the move transition
- Scale his content/affiliate business
- Build toward his entrepreneurial goals

He chats in a mix of Indonesian and English, casual style.
