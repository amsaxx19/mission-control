| # | Hook | Full Script | Platform | Angle | Product/Niche | CTA | Duration |
|---|------|-------------|----------|-------|---------------|-----|----------|
| 1 | "I quit my $80k job in Australia for this..." | **HOOK:** I quit my $80k job in Australia for this... [pause] **BODY:** Everyone called me crazy. My parents, my friends, even my boss said I'd regret it. But 30 days later? I'm making more from my phone than my office salary. Here's what I learned... **CTA:** Follow for Day 2. | TikTok | Resign | CuanBoss Journey | Follow for Day 2 | 30-45s |
| 2 | "Day 1: I just resigned from my Aussie office job" | **HOOK:** Day 1: I just resigned from my Aussie office job. [look at camera] **BODY:** 3 years in Sydney. $80k salary. Stable life. Gone. Why? Because I realized something scary — I was replaceable. AI is coming for my job. So I made a choice: build something AI can't take from me. **CTA:** Save this if you're thinking of quitting too. | TikTok | Resign | CuanBoss Journey | Save this | 30s |
| 3 | "POV: You finally escaped the 9-5 matrix" | **HOOK:** POV: You finally escaped the 9-5 matrix. [visual: packing box] **BODY:** No more 2-hour commutes. No more pointless meetings. No more "per my last email." Just me, my laptop, and the freedom to build my own empire. And guess what? Day 1 feels... terrifying. But also? Alive. **CTA:** Comment "escaped" if you feel this. | TikTok | Resign | CuanBoss Journey | Comment "escaped" | 25s |
| 4 | "They said I was crazy for leaving Australia" | **HOOK:** They said I was crazy for leaving Australia. [pause] **BODY:** "Amos, you have PR. Good salary. Safe future." Yeah, safe. But safe doesn't build wealth. Safe doesn't create legacy. Safe is just... comfortable. And comfortable is where dreams go to die. **CTA:** Follow if you're choosing growth over comfort. | TikTok | Resign | CuanBoss Journey | Follow for growth | 30s |
| 5 | "What nobody tells you about quitting your job" | **HOOK:** What nobody tells you about quitting your job... **BODY:** Everyone talks about the freedom. Nobody talks about the 3 AM panic. The "what if I fail?" thoughts. The anxiety of no guaranteed paycheck. But here's what I realized — those 3 AM thoughts? They're just growing pains. **CTA:** Save if you needed to hear this. | TikTok | Resign | CuanBoss Journey | Save this | 35s |
| 6 | "I moved back to Indonesia and this happened" | **HOOK:** I moved back to Indonesia and this happened... [visual: shocked face] **BODY:** Sydney: $2,500/month rent. Jakarta: $500. Sydney: $15 coffee. Jakarta: $2. Sydney: 2 hours commute. Jakarta: work from anywhere. Same income, 5x the runway. Sometimes going backward is actually going forward. **CTA:** Follow for the full breakdown. | TikTok | Kabur | CuanBoss Journey | Follow for breakdown | 30s |
| 7 | "Leaving Sydney was the best decision" | **HOOK:** Leaving Sydney was the best decision I ever made. **BODY:** I traded harbor views for hustle. I traded "work-life balance" for building something I own. I traded safety nets for wings. And 30 days in? Zero regrets. **CTA:** Comment "best decision" if you agree. | TikTok | Kabur | CuanBoss Journey | Comment "best decision" | 25s |
| 8 | "From Australian office to Indonesian entrepreneur" | **HOOK:** From Australian office to Indonesian entrepreneur. Here's Day 1... **BODY:** [show workspace] This is my new office. No cubicle. No fluorescent lights. Just me, my vision, and 48 hours to prove this works. Let's go. **CTA:** Follow the journey. | TikTok | Kabur | CuanBoss Journey | Follow the journey | 20s |
| 9 | "Why I said goodbye to my Aussie salary" | **HOOK:** Why I said goodbye to my Aussie salary... [pause] **BODY:** Simple math. $80k/year = $6.6k/month. After tax, rent, living? Maybe $1k savings. My TikTok affiliate business? Already doing $1.5k/month. And it grows. Salary doesn't. **CTA:** Save if this math hits different. | TikTok | Kabur | CuanBoss Journey | Save this | 35s |
| 10 | "The truth about moving back to Indo" | **HOOK:** The truth about moving back to Indo nobody talks about... **BODY:** Yes, it's cheaper. Yes, family is close. But the real win? The time. I have 16 hours a day to build. In Sydney? I had 3 hours after work and commute. Time is the real currency. **CTA:** Follow for daily updates. | TikTok | Kabur | CuanBoss Journey | Follow for updates | 30s |
| 11 | "This gadget saved me $500/month — here's how" | **HOOK:** This gadget saved me $500/month — here's how... **BODY:** [show product] Smart thermostat. $100 investment. Cut my electricity bill by 40%. In 3 months, it paid for itself. Now? Pure savings. Small investments, big returns. **CTA:** Link in bio for discount. | TikTok | Value | Smart Home | Link in bio | 25s |
| 12 | "3 products that changed my life (under $50)" | **HOOK:** 3 products that changed my life (under $50)... **BODY:** 1. LED desk lamp — no more eye strain. 2. Cable organizer — workspace zen. 3. Phone stand — posture fixed. Total: $47. Impact: Priceless. **CTA:** Comment which one you need. | TikTok | Value | Productivity | Comment below | 30s |
| 13 | "I wish I knew about this TikTok Shop hack sooner" | **HOOK:** I wish I knew about this TikTok Shop hack sooner... **BODY:** [screen record] Search trending products → Filter by 7-day growth → Pick items with 50%+ growth but under 100 reviews. Blue ocean. Low competition. High potential. **CTA:** Save this before it gets buried. | TikTok | Secret | TikTok Strategy | Save this | 35s |
| 14 | "Stop buying these 3 products (do this instead)" | **HOOK:** Stop buying these 3 products. Do this instead... **BODY:** ❌ Expensive coffee maker → ✅ French press ($15, same quality) ❌ Branded skincare → ✅ Korean dupes (same ingredients) ❌ Gym membership → ✅ Resistance bands set ($30) **CTA:** Follow for more money-saving hacks. | TikTok | Pain | Lifestyle | Follow for more | 35s |
| 15 | "The [product] hack nobody talks about" | **HOOK:** The TikTok Shop hack nobody talks about... **BODY:** Most affiliates promote what's already trending. Wrong. Find products with high views but low affiliate competition. How? Check TikTok Shop analytics → Products → Filter by "Low affiliates." That's your goldmine. **CTA:** Save this secret. | TikTok | Secret | TikTok Strategy | Save this | 40s |
| 16 | "Day 2: Nobody prepared me for this feeling" | **HOOK:** Day 2 of resigning: Nobody prepared me for this feeling... **BODY:** It's not excitement. It's not fear. It's... clarity. For the first time, my time is 100% mine. No boss. No meetings. Just decisions that matter. And it's terrifyingly beautiful. **CTA:** Follow if you're chasing this feeling. | TikTok | Resign | CuanBoss Journey | Follow for journey | 30s |
| 17 | "My parents still don't understand why I left" | **HOOK:** My parents still don't understand why I left Australia... **BODY:** To them, stability = success. Salary = security. But they don't see what I see. AI replacing jobs. Friends getting laid off. The "safe" path isn't safe anymore. Building something I own? That's the only security. **CTA:** Comment if your parents don't get it. | TikTok | Resign | CuanBoss Journey | Comment below | 35s |
| 18 | "The numbers don't lie — why I had to quit" | **HOOK:** The numbers don't lie. Here's why I had to quit... **BODY:** [show calculation] Office job: 50 hrs/week, $80k = $30/hour. TikTok affiliate: 20 hrs/week, $25k/month = $312/hour. Same effort, 10x return. Math made the decision for me. **CTA:** Save if the math makes sense to you. | TikTok | Resign | CuanBoss Journey | Save this | 35s |
| 19 | "Day 3: The first failure already happened" | **HOOK:** Day 3: The first failure already happened... **BODY:** [show messed up project] Spent 6 hours on content. Flopped. 200 views. But here's the thing — in my old job, failure meant getting fired. Now? Failure means I'm learning. And that mindset shift? Everything. **CTA:** Follow to see Day 4 comeback. | TikTok | Resign | CuanBoss Journey | Follow for Day 4 | 30s |
| 20 | "What my old boss said when I resigned" | **HOOK:** What my old boss said when I resigned... **BODY:** "You're making a mistake." "The market is tough." "You'll be back." Maybe. But I'd rather fail trying to build something I own than succeed building someone else's dream. **CTA:** Comment what your boss would say. | TikTok | Resign | CuanBoss Journey | Comment below | 30s |
| 21 | "I burned my boats. No going back now." | **HOOK:** I burned my boats. No going back now. [visual: one-way ticket] **BODY:** Sold my furniture. Ended my lease. Gave away half my stuff. This isn't a vacation. This is a one-way ticket to my new life. Scared? Absolutely. Committed? More than ever. **CTA:** Follow if you're all-in on your dreams. | TikTok | Kabur | CuanBoss Journey | Follow for journey | 30s |
| 22 | "The moment I knew I had to leave Australia" | **HOOK:** The moment I knew I had to leave Australia... **BODY:** It was 6 PM. Still in the office. Missed my wife's call. Again. Realized I'd spent more time with my laptop than my family this month. That was it. I chose people over paycheck. **CTA:** Save if you feel this. | TikTok | Kabur | CuanBoss Journey | Save this | 30s |
| 23 | "48 hours in Indonesia: Culture shock is real" | **HOOK:** 48 hours in Indonesia: Culture shock is real... **BODY:** The traffic. The noise. The heat. But also? The warmth. The hustle. The " anything is possible" energy. Sydney taught me discipline. Indonesia is teaching me hunger. **CTA:** Follow for daily updates. | TikTok | Kabur | CuanBoss Journey | Follow for updates | 30s |
| 24 | "Why 'kabur' from Australia was my only option" | **HOOK:** Why 'kabur' from Australia was my only option... **BODY:** Not because I hated it. Because I loved it too much. The comfort was killing my ambition. The stability was numbing my hunger. Sometimes you have to leave what you love to become who you're meant to be. **CTA:** Comment if you've ever felt this. | TikTok | Kabur | CuanBoss Journey | Comment below | 35s |
| 25 | "My Sydney friends think I'm crazy. They're right." | **HOOK:** My Sydney friends think I'm crazy. They're right. **BODY:** Crazy enough to believe I can build something. Crazy enough to bet on myself. Crazy enough to choose uncertainty over comfort. And honestly? I hope they think I'm crazy. Because safe choices create average lives. **CTA:** Follow if you're crazy too. | TikTok | Kabur | CuanBoss Journey | Follow if you relate | 30s |
