# TikTok Affiliate Domination Strategy

## Background
Amos has been running TikTok affiliate for 1 year. Revenue stuck at 10-25jt/month despite:
- 4x daily posting
- Multiple viral videos (100K-10M views)
- Winning products: books, hair dye, nasal spray, children's books
- Strategy: targeting insecurities

## Goal
Scale to 100jt+/month + build unforgettable personal brand (like Big Mo in livestreaming).

## Content Style
- Storytelling talking head
- Walking around house holding phone
- Raw, authentic, polarizing

## Influencer References
1. **Big Mo** — Strong personal branding in livestreaming, authenticity key
2. **Timothy Ronald** — Gen Z, plans every word for virality, polarizing (loved OR hated, never middle)

## Content Angles (Amos Ideas)
1. **PR in Australia** — Call out influencers using student/WHV visas, struggling in Australia
2. **"Escape Indonesia" Critique** — Call them cowards (pecundang), anti-kabur narrative
3. **Day 1 Series** — Planning to quit office job, countdown to resignation
4. **Return to Indonesia** — Despite having Australian PR, choosing to come back

## Deliverables Needed
