# TASK-004 Research: AI News Sources & Search Strategy

## Summary
- ✅ **The Verge AI section** — High quality, consistent publishing, good extraction
- ⚠️ **Current search queries** work but need refinement for signal/noise ratio
- ⚠️ **Rate limits** are a real concern (Brave free tier = 1 req/sec)

---

## 1. Best AI News Sources (Validated)

### Tier 1 — Reliable, Daily Updates
| Source | Quality | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **The Verge AI** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Clean extraction, focused coverage, timely |
| **TechCrunch AI** | ⭐⭐⭐ | Good stories but site has heavy promotional content |
| **Ars Technica** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Deep technical coverage, slower pace |
| **Wired AI** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Good analysis, less frequent |

### Tier 2 — Aggregators/Fast News
| Source | Quality | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **Reddit r/artificial** | ⭐⭐⭐ | Community-curated, need filtering |
| **Hacker News** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Tech-focused, high signal |

---

## 2. Search Query Testing Results

### Current Queries (from morning-briefing.js)
```javascript
const QUERIES = [
  'AI artificial intelligence news today',
  'OpenAI GPT ChatGPT updates',
  'AI startup funding news',
  'machine learning breakthrough 2025 2026'
];
```

### Test Results

**Query 1: "AI artificial intelligence news today"**
- ✅ Returns diverse sources (NYT, Yahoo Finance, Indian Express)
- ⚠️ Includes generic "tech news" pages that aren't AI-specific
- ⚠️ Some results are 24-48h old despite "today"

**Query 2: "OpenAI GPT ChatGPT updates"** 
- ✅ High relevance when major news breaks
- ⚠️ Duplicates with Query 1 during big OpenAI announcements
- ⚠️ Can miss Anthropic/Google news

**Query 3-4:** Not tested (rate limited)

---

## 3. Recommendations

### A. Optimize Search Queries
```javascript
const BETTER_QUERIES = [
  'OpenAI Anthropic Google AI news today',           // Major players
  'AI startup funding Series A B C 2025 2026',       // Funding news
  'ChatGPT Claude Gemini new features updates',      // Product updates
  'AI agents automation enterprise news',            // Enterprise/trends
  'large language model LLM benchmark breakthrough'  // Research/tech
];
```

**Why:** More specific queries reduce noise and avoid duplicate coverage.

### B. Add Direct RSS Feeds (Fallback Strategy)
Brave API has rate limits (1 req/sec on free tier). Add RSS as backup:
- `https://www.theverge.com/rss/ai-artificial-intelligence/index.xml`
- `https://techcrunch.com/category/artificial-intelligence/feed/`
- `https://news.ycombinator.com/rss` (filter for AI keywords)

### C. Quality Scoring
Add simple heuristics to filter low-quality results:
```javascript
function scoreResult(result) {
  let score = 0;
  if (result.description?.length > 80) score += 2;
  if (result.title?.includes('AI') || result.title?.includes('OpenAI')) score += 1;
  if (['nytimes.com', 'theverge.com', 'techcrunch.com'].includes(result.siteName)) score += 2;
  return score;
}
```

### D. Rate Limit Handling
Current script has 200ms delay between queries = risk of 429 errors.
**Fix:** Increase to 1100ms minimum (1 req/sec limit).

---

## 4. Risks & Concerns

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Brave API rate limits | HIGH | Add delays, implement RSS fallback |
| Duplicate stories across queries | MEDIUM | Deduplicate by URL + title similarity |
| Stale content (24-48h old) | LOW | Add freshness filter + RSS |
| Promotional/paywall content | MEDIUM | Domain whitelist for Tier 1 sources |

---

## 5. Next Steps

1. **Implement query updates** — Use recommended query set
2. **Add RSS fallback** — The Verge feed is reliable
3. **Increase API delays** — 1100ms between requests
4. **Test end-to-end** — Run full briefing generation

Ready to help with implementation if needed.
