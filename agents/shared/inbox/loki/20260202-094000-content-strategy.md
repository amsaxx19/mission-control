# URGENT: Personal Brand Content Strategy

Amos mau build personal brand kuat (kayak Big Mo) + scale TikTok affiliate.

## Background
- Current: Talking head, jalan2 di rumah, 4x post/hari
- Revenue stuck: 10-25jt/bulan
- Style: Storytelling, raw, authentic
- Goal: Unforgettable personal brand + 100jt+/bulan

## Deliverables

### 1. Personal Brand Manifesto
"The Anti-Kabur PR" — yang punya PR Australia tapi pilih balik Indonesia, bantai para "kabur" influencer.

Define:
- Core message
- Tone of voice (raw, polarizing, authentic)
- Positioning vs other creators

### 2. Two-Account Strategy
**Account 1: Affiliate** — Pure product focus
**Account 2: Personal Brand** — Anti-kabur, PR life, authenticity

Content mix untuk masing2.

### 3. Content Framework
- **Day 1 Series** — Planning to quit office job (countdown)
- **PR Australia** — Call out visa abusers
- **Kabur Critique** — Why leaving Indonesia is cowardly
- **Return to Indo** — Building business despite having PR

### 4. Hook Templates (20 hooks)
Based on polarizing angles:
- Disliked but respected
- Controversial takes
- Authentic struggles

### 5. 7-Day Content Calendar
Mix of affiliate + personal brand posts.

## Rules (From Timothy Ronald)
- Plan every word
- Must be LOVED or HATED — never middle
- Authenticity > Polish
- Polarizing = Viral

## Deliver by: Tomorrow 12 PM

This is Amos's priority #1 untuk scale bisnisnya.
