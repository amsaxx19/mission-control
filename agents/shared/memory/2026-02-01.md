## Key Decisions

1. **Architecture:** File-based message bus over complex database
2. **Communication:** Async messaging via inbox folders
3. **Memory:** WORKING.md + daily notes pattern
4. **Deployment:** Static UI + Supabase backend

## Agents Active
- **Jarvis:** Coordinating, monitoring
- **Friday:** Completed email system
- **Shuri:** Researching TikTok competitors
- **Loki:** Idle, awaiting tasks
- **Wong:** Documenting, maintaining 2nd Brain

## Blockers
- Cron timeout prevents other agent heartbeats
- Solution: File-based coordination working well
