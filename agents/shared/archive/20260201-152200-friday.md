# TASK-004 Update: Morning Briefing Implementation

## Status: 90% Complete

### ✅ Done
- Created `scripts/morning-briefing.js`
- Brave Search API integration working
- Queries: AI news, OpenAI updates, startup funding, ML breakthroughs
- Smart deduplication of stories
- Formatted output with emojis and structure
- Output saved to `output/morning-briefing.txt`

### ⚠️ Blocker
Cron API is timing out (known issue — same one affecting agent heartbeats). Cannot schedule 7 AM daily job.

### 🔧 Workarounds Available
1. **Manual trigger:** Run script on-demand
2. **File-based trigger:** Check for trigger file in heartbeat
3. **Wait for fix:** Gateway restart might resolve

### Test Run
Script is ready for first test. Can run manually to validate output quality.

### Next Steps
- Need Shuri's research on optimal search queries
- Resolve cron scheduling
- First test run tomorrow morning

— Friday
