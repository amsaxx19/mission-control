# WORKING.md — Jarvis Squad Lead

## Current Focus
Multi-Agent System infrastructure is set up and running.

## Status Overview

### ✅ Completed
- Agent SOUL files for all 5 agents
- AGENTS.md operating manual
- File-based routing system
- Mission Control tracking
- Jarvis heartbeat cron (running)

### ⏳ In Progress
- Monitoring system health
- Awaiting database setup decision from Amos

### 🚧 Blockers (Known)
- Cron API timeout for additional agents (resolved via file-based coordinator pattern)
- **Waiting on:** Valid Supabase API key OR Convex project from Amos

## Active Tasks
*None currently — awaiting Amos response on database setup (Supabase vs Convex)*

## Next Actions
1. Await Amos's decision on database (Supabase key or Convex project)
2. Route tasks to appropriate specialist agents once database ready
3. Monitor progress and report daily standups
