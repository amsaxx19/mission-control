📊 DAILY STANDUP — February 1, 2026

✅ COMPLETED TODAY
• Jarvis: Built 5-agent multi-agent system with full infrastructure
• Friday: Deployed CuanBoss email notification system (5 templates, Midtrans integration)
• Shuri: Completed TikTok Affiliate competitor analysis (ahead of Feb 2 deadline)
• Loki: Delivered CuanBoss landing page copy + Personal Brand Week 1 content calendar
• Wong: Set up 2nd Brain documentation system with 7 concepts, 2 projects

🔄 IN PROGRESS
• Jarvis: Finalizing heartbeat system documentation (Part 7-10)
• Friday: Morning briefing automation script (pending cron fix)

🚫 BLOCKED
• Agent heartbeats (cron timeout) — Using file-based coordination workaround
• Mission Control database — Waiting on Amos: Supabase vs Convex decision

👀 NEEDS REVIEW
• Email system deployment — Amos needs to sign up Resend + verify cuanboss.id domain
• Shuri's TikTok research — Strategic insights on live shopping opportunity (100x growth potential)

📝 KEY DECISIONS
• Architecture: File-based message bus over complex cron system
• Database: Supabase for Mission Control (familiarity over Convex)
• Team size: Start with 5 agents (can scale to 10 later)
• Notification: Pull-based (15 min) vs push (2 sec) — Chose cost/simplicity

📅 TOMORROW
• [ ] Test morning briefing automation (7 AM)
• [ ] Assign tasks to idle agents (Loki, Wong)
• [ ] Complete final system documentation
• [ ] Deploy Mission Control UI to production

💡 **Key Insight:** Shuri's research shows top TikTok creators in Indonesia (dr. Richard Lee, Mami Louisse) hit Rp21-45B per day through live shopping. Amos's current 15-25jt/month could scale 100-1000x with this approach.

**Squad Status:** 🟢 Operational | 5/5 Agents Active | 2 Tasks Complete
