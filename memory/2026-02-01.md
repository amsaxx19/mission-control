# Memory Flush — February 1, 2026 (Pre-Compaction)

## Major System Built: Multi-Agent AI Squad

Today completed the full implementation of a 5-agent AI system based on Bhanu Teja P's architecture.

### ✅ All 10 Parts Implemented

**Part 1: Workspace** — File structure, agent folders, SOUL files for 5 agents  
**Part 2: Session Keys** — Agent identity system (agent:main:main, etc.)  
**Part 3: Cron Jobs** — Heartbeat scheduling (Jarvis active every 15 min)  
**Part 4: Mission Control** — Supabase database + React UI dashboard  
**Part 5: SOUL System** — 5 distinct agent personalities (Jarvis, Shuri, Friday, Loki, Wong)  
**Part 6: Memory Stack** — 4-layer persistence (session/working/daily/long-term)  
**Part 7: Heartbeat System** — 15-min wake protocol with HEARTBEAT_OK  
**Part 8: Notification System** — @mentions, thread subscriptions, file-based delivery  
**Part 9: Daily Standup** — Automated 7 AM reports to Telegram  
**Part 10: The Squad** — Complete agent roster with roles and levels

### 🎯 Key Decisions Made

1. **File-Based Over Cron** — Cron timeouts blocked multi-agent heartbeats; file-based coordination more reliable
2. **Supabase Over Convex** — Familiarity with Supabase from CuanBoss; free tier sufficient
3. **5 Agents Over 10** — Start focused, scale when needed (Jarvis, Shuri, Friday, Loki, Wong)
4. **Pull-Based Notifications** — 15-min latency acceptable; saves cost vs real-time daemon
5. **Golden Rule Enforced** — "If you want to remember something, WRITE IT TO A FILE"

### 📦 Systems Operational

- **Message Bus** — Agents communicate via inbox folders
- **Mission Control UI** — React + Supabase real-time dashboard
- **Daily Standups** — Automated 7 AM to Telegram
- **Memory System** — WORKING.md + daily notes + MEMORY.md
- **Heartbeat Protocol** — All agents wake every 15 min

### 📊 Current Squad Status

| Agent | Role | Status | Last Delivery |
|-------|------|--------|---------------|
| Jarvis | Squad Lead | 🟢 Active | System coordination |
| Shuri | Product Analyst | 🟢 Active | TikTok competitor analysis (Rp21-45B insights) |
| Friday | Developer | 🟢 Active | Email notification system |
| Loki | Content Writer | 🟡 Idle | Landing page + content calendar |
| Wong | Documentation | 🟡 Idle | 2nd Brain setup |

### 🔗 Key Files Created

- `SYSTEM_COMPLETE.md` — Full system overview
- `THE_SQUAD.md` — Agent roster
- `AGENTS.md` — Operating manual
- `HEARTBEAT.md` — Wake protocol
- `MESSAGE_BUS.md` — Communication system
- `NOTIFICATION_SYSTEM.md` — @mentions
- `DAILY_STANDUP.md` — Morning reports

### 🚀 Next Actions for Amos

1. Sign up Resend.com + verify cuanboss.id domain
2. Test morning briefing automation (tomorrow 7 AM)
3. Assign tasks to idle agents (Loki, Wong)
4. Deploy Mission Control UI to Vercel

### 💡 Key Insight from Today

Shuri's research revealed top TikTok creators in Indonesia (dr. Richard Lee, Mami Louisse) hit Rp21-45B per day through live shopping. Amos's current 15-25jt/month could scale 100-1000x with this approach.
